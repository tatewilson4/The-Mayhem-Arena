Game Concept
You can choose to be one of two players, Zangief or Akuma. There are a total of four rounds and one sudden death round if it comes to it. Each player gets to choose to do one of three things. They can do a regular attack, a critical attack or use a revive potion. One player must get a K.O to move on to the next round. In order to win the game you must get three K.O’s. 


Objective
-Player needs to get three K.O’s to win.
	-The player needs to maintain his health, and get the other players health to 0.
-The player has four rounds to get three K.O’s.
-If neither side has gotten four K.O’s by the end of the fourth round, you move have the option to move on to round four or give up.


Instructions
Welcome to the Mayhem Arena. This is a two player game and you can choose between two different characters. You have an attack button which is garunteed to hit the opponent. You also have a critical attack option which delivers a more powerful blow. The critical attack only has a 30% chance of landing on your opponent. The last option that you have is a revive potion. This will restore your health by 30 points of it\'s original 100. If you win the round, you have the option to upgrade you attack by 10, but you do forfeit your turn. If you pass, you still go first.
